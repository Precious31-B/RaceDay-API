## Project Structure

- `RaceDay.API/` - The RESTful Web API and Database Context.
- `RaceDay.Tests/` - Unit tests for the API.
- `RaceDay.Web/` - The MVC front-end application.

## Setup Instructions (Local Development)

### 1. API Setup
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022.
2. Ensure the connection string in `RaceDay.API/appsettings.json` points to your local SQL Server.
3. Open the Package Manager Console (Default project: `RaceDay.API`) and run:
   ```powershell
   Update-

Run the RaceDay.API project (Press F5). Swagger will open.

2. MVC Web App Setup
Set RaceDay.Web as the startup project (or configure Multiple Startup Projects).

Run the application (Press F5). It will communicate with the local API.

Docker Setup (Part 3 Requirement)
The MVC application is fully containerized.

Ensure the API is running locally on port 5004 (http://localhost:5004).

Open a terminal and navigate to the MVC project folder:

bash
cd RaceDay.Web
Build the Docker image:

bash
docker build -t raceday-web .
Run the container, passing the API URL environment variable so the container can reach the host machine:

bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e "ApiSettings__BaseUrl=http://host.docker.internal:5004" --name raceday-mvc raceday-web
Access the application at http://localhost:8080.

Azure Blob Storage
The API is integrated with Azure Blob Storage for uploading event banner images. Images are uploaded via the API and the resulting URL is stored in the database. The connection string is configured in RaceDay.API/appsettings.json.
